Hi there, I'm Samuel Colburn, a software engineer by day. Sardine Sound is my side-gig. I get a lot of help hauling gear around from my spouse Val. We've worked together to bring sound to community theater productions and various events since 2016.

I was heavily engaged in theater (both technical and on stage) in high school and continued my technical theater pursuits in college for a year or two, after which I set it aside to lean in more on hobbies related to programming and networking. About a decade later, in 2016, my spouse convinced me to get back into technical theater because their production of Godspell needed someone to run the mixer. After that first show back at the board, I was hooked again. I invested in some live audio equipment to improve the my capabilities and have been mixing audio for community theater, local schools, and small events in the area ever since.
