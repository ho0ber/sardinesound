Summary: 

## What is this?
This document serves as a guide and list of requirements for engaging Sardine Sound for an event. It is a work in progress, but the goal of the document is to give a client everything they need to know to run a successful show with us.

This checklist applies to non-theater gigs, including small concerts, speakers, panels, recorded music, and karaoke.

## Booking Prerequisites
* Event dates must be confirmed to ensure availability
* Contact information for the client or coordinator
* A preliminary venue (even if not yet booked/confirmed) must be provided
* A fee and payment schedule must be agreed upon for the event

# Timeline
## 1 Month Before Event
* A venue must be confirmed. If we haven't worked in this venue before, depending on the complexity of the event, we *may* need a walk-through of the venue to understand the challenges and offerings of the space.
* Load-in and load-out parking information must be provided
* A schedule including load-in, load-out, and timing of sound needs must be provided
* If the event spans multiple days, a plan for keeping equipment safe in the venue between rehearsals and shows must be coordinated

## 1 Week Before Event
* A final list of client-provided and Sardine Sound provided microphones and other sound equipment must be confirmed
* If a playlist of music is required, it must be provided as a Spotify playlist or through other agreed-upon means
* If client or coordinator won't be on-site at load-in time, contact information for venue must be provided
