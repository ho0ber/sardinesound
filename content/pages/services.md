Summary: 

I've got a pretty broad set of capabilities for an amateur, but a very limited set of capabilities for a pro. I like to think I land somewhere in the middle. The minor leagues of live audio, if you will.

Here's what I currently am equipped to run sound for:

## Community Theater Productions
* Live-mixing performers using group-provided beltpack or handheld microphones
* With a live orchestra or backing tracks
* Designing and performing sound effects/cues

## Small concerts/gigs
* Live-mixing performers with limited wired microphones
* A capella
* With backing tracks
* With musician-provided micing or line-outs

## Talks, lectures, and panels
* Providing up to four of our own wired microphones
* Providing zero (soon to be rectified) wireless handheld microphones
* Feedback elimination provided for *speakers* who love walking in front of *speakers*

## Music for parties and gatherings
* With a provided playlist/tracklist
* Seriously, I'm not a good DJ
* You really don't want to hear what I want to play

## Pretty much anything else you can think of
* Provided it requires similar equipment and time commitment
