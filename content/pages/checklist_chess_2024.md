## What is this?
This document serves as a guide and list of requirements for engaging Sardine Sound for a show. It is a work in progress, but the goal of the document is to give a director/producer everything they need to know to run a successful show with us.

This checklist applies to theatrical shows with an orchestra or band as live accompaniment.
