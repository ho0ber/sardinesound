Summary: 

## What is this?
This document serves as a guide and list of requirements for engaging Sardine Sound for a show. It is a work in progress, but the goal of the document is to give a director/producer everything they need to know to run a successful show with us.

This checklist applies to theatrical shows with no live accompaniment, only backing tracks played through the sound system.

## Booking Prerequisites
* Show count and dates must be confirmed to ensure availability
* Contact information for the director and music director must be provided
* A preliminary venue (even if not yet booked/confirmed) must be provided
* A fee and payment schedule must be agreed upon for the show. If the show is operated by a nonprofit community theater group, the budget for the show must be approved by the board of directors at a board meeting.
* The director must agree to spend at least one rehearsal in the venue with a technical focus (a cue-to-cue, generally) before final dress rehearsals
* The director must agree to the timeline below

# Timeline

* A cue sheet listing all sound effects, music, and entrances/exits of mic'd performers must be provided
* DRM-free audio files for the backing tracks must be provided
* A stage monitor plan for the performers must be coordinated with the director and music director to ensure performers will be able to hear their backing tracks
