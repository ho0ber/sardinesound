Summary: 

I don't currently publish exact pricing packages, as my fees vary by project based on needs, budget, and how excited I am to help out.

I've never charged more than $1000 for any gig, and most are well under that, especially for short engagements.

Many of my gigs have ranged from $300-$500, based on the time commitment and the amount of my equipment being put at risk.

Several of my gigs, especially single day events, have been free of charge if they support something I'm passionate about.

Thus far, I've not turned a profit. I've invested all of my modest fees into the purchase of and maintenance of equipment used in this hobby. I'm not doing this to make money, I'm doing it to help out and to have an excuse to have some really cool gear.
