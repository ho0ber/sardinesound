Summary: 

## What is this?
This document serves as a guide and list of requirements for engaging Sardine Sound for a show. It is a work in progress, but the goal of the document is to give a director/producer everything they need to know to run a successful show with us.

## Booking Prerequisites
* Show count and dates must be confirmed to ensure availability
* Contact information for the director and music director must be provided
* A rough orchestra type/makeup must be provided
* A preliminary venue (even if not yet booked/confirmed) must be provided
* A fee must be agreed upon for the show. If the show is operated by a nonprofit community theater group, the budget for the show must be approved by the board of directors at a board meeting.
* The director must agree to spend at least one rehearsal in the venue with a technical focus (a cue-to-cue, generally) before final dress rehearsals

# Timeline
## 2 Months Before Show
* A venue must be confirmed. If we haven't worked in this venue before, we will need a walk-through of the venue to understand the challenges and offerings of the space.
* If sound effects/cues are required for the show, a preliminary list of those cues/needs should be provided along with a copy of the script.

## 1 Month Before Show
* A full schedule including load-in, cue-to-cue, dress rehearsal, show, and strike dates and times (including end times) must be provided
* A plan for keeping equipment safe in the venue between rehearsals and shows must be coordinated
* A list of all parts/performers who are being mic'd must be provided
* A cue sheet listing all sound effects, and entrances/exits of mic'd performers must be provided
* A microphone and monitor plan for the orchestra must be coordinated with the music director if they want to have any sort of additional instrument micing or monitors to hear performers
